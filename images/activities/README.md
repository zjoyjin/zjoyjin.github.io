## How to Add Your Activity Photos

1. **Add photos to this folder** (`images/activities/`)
2. **Recommended specs:**
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 600x400px (landscape, 3:2 ratio)
   - File size: Under 300KB
   - Clear, high-quality photos showing the activity/organization

3. **Update activities.html:**
   - Find the activity item you want to update
   - Change the `src` from placeholder to your image:
     ```html
     <img src="images/activities/cssu-photo.jpg" alt="CSSU event" />
     ```

## Suggested Photos:

- **CSSU**: Group photo, event photo, or CSSU logo/branding
- **UofTAI**: Workshop/event photo, team photo, or promotional material

## Tips:

- Use landscape orientation (horizontal) for best layout
- Photos with people or activity in action work best
- Ensure good lighting and clarity
