2. **Recommended specs:**
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Size: 400x400px (square, 1:1 ratio)
   - File size: Under 200KB
   - Action shots or representative imagery

3. **Update activities.html:**
   - Find the hobby item you want to update
   - Change the `src` from placeholder to your image:
     ```html
     <img src="images/hobbies/art-photo.jpg" alt="My artwork" />
     ```

## Suggested Photos:

- **Art**: Your artwork, you creating art, or art supplies
